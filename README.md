# Heyo, I'm [Nelson](https://nelsonsilvadev.com/)! 👋🏻︎

### Who am I? 🧑🏻

In a nutshell, I'm a ~~mostly~~ _self-taught_ **frontend developer** that _breathes_ **caffeine** (_I didn't learn to fall in love with what I do, it happened naturally as if it had already been planned_). I've been **passionate** _about_ the **programming universe** _since_ **2010**, I **don't limit** _myself_ to **learning** _only_ part of it, but to **learn as much as I can** (_I always preferred to know many things and not much about a few things_).

### What I'm focusing on 💻

**[Caffeine Algorithm](https://caffeinealgorithm.com/)**, a **development community** that _loves_ **caffeine** and **algorithms** and that has as _main_ **mission** to _help the largest number of people to know the programming universe_, so that they can, **acquire new knowledge and evolve even more**.
